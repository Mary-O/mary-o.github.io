It's not a very exciting first post but hey here we are. We're powered by [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com) and I can use Markdown to author my posts. That last sentence was totally just from the tutorial. I am still not super sure what markdown is and all that. Also the date the tutorial used is 2014 so...hope it's still relevant!
