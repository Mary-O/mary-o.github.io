<p>So I'm a person, not a company. "Why the CO?" you might ask. Well, I'd tell you, the CO actually stands for Catherine Owczarzak. Mary CO, it's my name. HappyMaryCO was my first ever online username; it was an AOL account I created as a child and check infrequently enough that AOL had to "purge" my inbox. Which sounds terrifying.</p> 
<p>I was not even four years old (actually) and I sat with my parents, who were totally on board with me using my name as an online handle. Unfortunately Mary@aol.com was taken. Bummer. What about MaryCO? Double bummer. As a four-year-old I must have been relatively happy because I remember the decision to land with HappyMaryCO was pretty instantaneous and it's stuck ever since.</p>
